# OnlineMeetingEngagement

This was an opportunity I've got in the beginning of my career, during my time at JPMorgan Chase & Co. . The project was focused on developing a system capable of assessing the engagement levels of participants during online meetings, with the aim to get an idea of the meeting's overall effectiveness. We started working on this project at a time when remote work practices just started to become popular during covid times. The idea behind the project was to use subtle facial expression of the participants in real time to predict an engagement score.
